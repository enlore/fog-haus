                    Business is changing. Sustainability and social innovation are at
                    the forefront, and this new age of global megacorps is rapidly
                    mutating.

                    We like that.

                p.
                    At fog, we understand that the new consumer is more demanding and savvier than
                    big companies are willing to admit. They want products with impact, that are
                    forward thinking, and culturally-relevant. They're smart, capable, and worth
                    knowing. They demand to be treated like humans.

                p.
                    And we know that demand will only intensify. Why? We’re just like you. We’re
                    consumers and we’re business owners. We're demanding. We support socially
                    conscious products. We understand that no one's going to build the future we
                    want for us. We’ve helped companies and cool individuals launch, grow, and
                    generate revenue while empowering their users to live better lives.

                p.
                    We started fog to do more of that.

                p.
                    Here’s how we do it.

                    p.
                        Need an investor, or are you applying for an accelerator to push and fund your
                        idea? We help you visualize your idea into a tangible design that refines your
                        concept, establishes business need, and outfits you wireframes and art
                        direction to help you make your pitch.

                        You’ve said to yourself, “This is it! I’ve got the idea that will radically
                        change ____!” Hold up. Before you spend an exorbitant fee on getting your idea
                        developed, think about the risk involved. Partner with us to build your MVP and
                        reduce your initial overhead in exchange for an equity stake. Share the burden

                    p.
                        When your needs are recurring (and, as they so often are, unpredictable), you
                        need good people on call. You need design or development help ASAP? Problem
                        solving? Firefighting? Consulting and training? We got you covered. As your
                        partner, our flexible workflow helps bolster your internal team or gives you

                        Your Project

                    p.
                        “I need a website.” “I need branding.” “I need an app.” We’ve heard them all
                        and we know how to help you. This is where we ask you a ton of questions,
                        figure out your goals, define the scope, create & refine a concept, design the
                        hell out of it, and develop it. Or any combination. You will be happy, and your
                        users will thank you. You’re welcome.
