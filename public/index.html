              Business is changing. Sustainability, social innovation, a
              tech savvy mentality, and machine intelligence are the new
              norms. The landscape of society is rapidly mutating.

              We understand that the new consumer is more demanding and savvier than
              big companies are willing to admit. We understand that being competitive
              means having more knowledge sooner. We understand the value of digital
              transformation, and we're lean and smart enough to actually get it done.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re just like you. We’re consumers and we’re business
              owners. We're demanding. We support socially conscious
              products. We understand that no one's going to build the
              future we want for us.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              We started fog to do just that.

            <p>
              Here’s how we do it.

                We'll help you validate your concept, test your product, and
